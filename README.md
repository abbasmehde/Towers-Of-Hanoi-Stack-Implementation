# Towers-Of-Hanoi-Stack-Implementation
This repository contains a C implementation of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle using stack data structures. It allows users to specify the number of disks and displays the state of the rods after each move. This project demonstrates the use of linked list-based stacks to solve the classic recursive problem.
